WTH (aka *What The Heck*) is **the better** personal information dashboard for 
your terminal, providing at-a-glance access to stats and data. It's a modular 
and extensible alternative to [WTF](https://github.com/wtfutil/wtf) and it's 
based on [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).
